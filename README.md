# TODO

- (always) GIT PULL
- high mse for xi9 in mbev estimation, suspect MGEV estimation is bad for these parameters. Stop
to make this work, maybe already work on bgev package structure and new version modifications. 
Try not to dig into a whole that creates other takss and problems. 

# Debugging/customization

- recall that first step estimation is done by using bgev.mle which sets custom upper and lower bounds. You can set them
manually to adjust your search, specially if you see parameters hitting the bounds.
